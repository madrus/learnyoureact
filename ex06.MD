 Exercise 6 of 11

Let's define styles as variables!

Variables are a smart way to make changes to multiple places in our code.
Lets assign some styles to a variable and see which parts of our code we can simplify.

# Challenge

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add style to index.jsx like below.

Before you start, you may want to check your current index.jsx into source
control, or create a new index.jsx for this exercise.

    import React from 'react';

    export default class TodoBox extends React.Component {
      // Omitted
    }

    class TodoList extends React.Component {
      // Omitted
    }

    class Todo extends React.Component {
      // Omitted
    }
    Todo.propTypes = {
      // Omitted
    };

    class TodoForm extends React.Component {
      // Omitted
    }

    let style = {
        tableContent: {
            border: "1px solid black"
        }
    };

Now change the code to use the style variable you added.
NOTE Some code is a little different from this style - be careful!

Inline Styles: [https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html)

After fixing your code, test it locally by running node program.js and
visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Once you're confident, run learnyoureact verify program.js.
