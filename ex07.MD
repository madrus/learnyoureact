 PROPS_FROM_SERVER
 Exercise 7 of 11

Let's pass data from the server into a component!

We're going to remove the data from our JSX, and pass it from the server instead.
This will require changing code on the server (program.js).

# Challenge

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modify TodoBox and TodoList in index.jsx like below.

Before you start, you may want to check your current index.jsx into source
control, or create a new index.jsx for this exercise.

In this code, TodoBox is the parent of all other components, so the server
will pass data into it, which it can access as {this.props.data}, and then
pass on down to TodoList.

In TodoList, we'll need to stop passing static values into our Todo
components. Instead, we'll loop through all of the values we're passed and
dynamically create Todo components for each. When dynamically creating
components like this, React makes use of a key attribute to keep track of
each component in the VirtualDOM. This allows it to update the real DOM as
sensibly and infrequently as possible. If you do not use key, React will
print a Warning in the console.

    import React from 'react';

    export default class TodoBox extends React.Component {
        render() {
        return (
          <div className="todoBox">
            <h1>Todos</h1>
            <TodoList data = {this.props.data} />
            <TodoForm />
          </div>
        );
      }
    }

    class TodoList extends React.Component {
        render() {
        var todo = this.props.data.map(function(obj) { return <Todo title={obj.title} key={obj.title}>{obj.detail}</Todo>});
        return (
          <div className = "todoList">
            <table style={{border: "2px solid black"}}>
              <tbody>
                {todo}
              </tbody>
            </table>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }

    class Todo extends React.Component {
      // Omitted
    }
    Todo.propTypes = {
      // Omitted
    };

    class TodoForm extends React.Component {
      // Omitted
    }

    let style = {
      // Omitted
    };

Next, we'll change the code on our server, program.js. Specifically, we'll change the
callback function of app.use() and pass it a data variable.

    var express = require('express');
    var app = express();

    app.set('port', (process.argv[2] || 3000));
    app.set('view engine', 'jsx');
    app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');
    app.engine('jsx', require('express-react-views').createEngine({ transformViews: false }));

    require('babel/register')({
        ignore: false
    });

    // write below
    var data = [];

    app.use('/', function(req, res) {
      res.render('index', {data: data});
    });

    app.listen(app.get('port'), function() {});

Now modify data to contain two objects. Each should have a title attribute,
defined as "Shopping" and "Hair cut" respectively. Each should also have
a detail attribute. These we want to make more dynamic.

See in program.js where we define which port to use? That's some Node.js that
allows passing values into your program from the command line. Specifically, it
says that the third command line argument is the port, and if it doesn't exist,
it defaults to 3000.

Make the value of detail for the first object equal to the fourth command line
argument, and detail for the second object equal to the fifth command line
argument.

Verify your code by running node program.js 3000 Milk 13:00 and visiting
http://localhost:3000.

Once you're confident, run learnyoureact verify program.js.

Bonus challenge: try removing the key attribute, and observe the Warning
printed to the console.
