 Exercise 9 of 11

Hey, wouldn't it be nice if todos got crossed out when we checked them off? Let's add that!

# Challenge

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update style in index.jsx as shown below.

Before you start, you may want to check your current index.jsx into source
control, or create a new index.jsx for this exercise.

    let style = {
        checkedTodo: {
            textDecoration: "line-through"
        },
        notCheckedTodo: {
            textDecoration: "none"
        },
        tableContent: {
            border: "1px solid black"
        }
    };

Now modify Todo to add line-through to tr if the checkbox is checked. And
if the checkbox is unchecked, remove line-through.

When you are ready, run node program.js 3000 Milk 13:00 and visit
http://localhost:3000 to see the HTML output in the browser.

Click the checkbox on and off, and confirm whether the line-through is added correctly.

When you feel confident, run learnyoureact verify program.js to check your solution.
